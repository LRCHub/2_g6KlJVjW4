(Now, it's, uh, "Love potion #9
Do you know "Love potion #9"?
Well, we're gonna do it for you
And it's gonna be the way you've never heard it before
The original. One, two, three)

I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
You know that gypsy
With the gold cap tooth
She's got a pad down at 34th and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of love potion number nine

So then I told her that I was flop with chicks
I been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm
And she made a magic sign
Try my little product now
"Love potion number nine" (what he said? One, two, three, four)

She bent down and turned around
And gave me a wink
She said, "I'm gonna mix it up
Right here in the sink"
It smelled like turpentine
Looked like India Ink
I held my nose
I closed my eyes
I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissing everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop
Down at 34th and Vine
He broke my little bottle of
Love potion number nine

I have so much fun, I'm going back again
I wonder what happened to love potion number 10

I'm number 10, I'm number 10, I'm number 10 (alright thank you, we're done, thanks a lot)
