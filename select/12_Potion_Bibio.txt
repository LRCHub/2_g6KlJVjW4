I wanna write a verse for each other
And sing it for no other
I would kill to be the other
Half of someone like you

Ooh, baby, I'd bottle this emotion
And drink it like a potion
I would die to make this moment
The last feeling I had

Oh, baby, I know it's an illusion
Or maybe just confusion
But I give in to my delusion
When the feeling's so beautiful

I wanna make a vow together
And live by it forever
But it's a drop in the ocean
With somebody like you

Oh, baby, oh, yeah
Oh, baby, oh, yeah
Oh, baby, oh, yeah
Oh, baby, oh, yeah

I wanna write a verse for еach other
And sing it for no other
I would kill to be thе other
Half of someone like you

Oh, baby, I'd bottle this emotion
And drink it like a potion
I would die to make this moment
The last feeling I had

Oh, baby, I know it's an illusion
Or maybe just confusion
But I give in to my delusion
When the feeling's so beautiful

I wanna make a vow together
And live by it forever
But it's a drop in the ocean
